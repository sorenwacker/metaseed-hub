"""The published documentation must disclose that it is AI-generated.

The EU AI Act's transparency obligations require AI-generated content to be
identifiable as such. The disclosure lives in ``mkdocs.yml``'s ``copyright``
field, which Material renders in the footer of every page — one declaration
covers the whole site, and this gate keeps it from silently disappearing.

The file is scanned as text rather than YAML-parsed so the gate cannot break
on mkdocs-specific YAML tags.
