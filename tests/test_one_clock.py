"""Every timestamp this code writes is UTC, and says so.

Every timestamp column is TIMESTAMPTZ with a database default, so stored
instants are unambiguous. What needed watching is the application side: a naive
`datetime.now()` records local time with no offset, unorderable against the
rest. Export filenames were stamped with the local date, so a file written at
01:00 CEST was dated a day ahead of the instant it was written.
