"""The Explorer's dropdowns do not list their own prompt as a choice.

Reported: opening *Base Profile (Reference)* showed "Profile" ticked at the top
of the list, above the profiles, as though it were one of them. The prompt was
an ordinary option with an empty value; the version dropdown did the same with
"Version". A prompt is shown in the closed control and left out of the list.
